Hi,

I'm Kipqalm, 2nd year french student in networking and system administration.

Currently working for Orange, as after-sales technician for corporate client's networks.
I'm still wondering about my future carreer. Mostly, I consider cybersecurity, system administration and virtualisation. Green IT could be great too.

Being new in this world, i'm curious about everything, aiming to a global understanding of IT functionnement.

I'll share in this repository some reminders, from my own researchs or found as is.
The objective is double. First, being a library of good practices/to-know-documents on which I can refer if necessary.
Second is to present to recruiters which fields I have already become familiar with.

Thanks for reading,
Time to see the real work ;)
